    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 eggs</li>
        <li>1 tbsp water</li>
        <li>1/4 cup sugar</li>
        <li>1/2 cup milk</li>
        <li>2 tsp vanilla extract</li>
        <li>2 cups flour</li>
        <li>1 tsp baking powder</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp salt</li>
        <li>1/4 tsp cinnamon</li>
        <li>3-4 cups canola or vegatable oil, (For frying)</li>
        <li>powdered sugar, (For topping)</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Preparation</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Combine eggs, water, sugar, milk and vanilla into a mixing bowl and beat with hand mixer until frothy. Mix flour, baking powder, salt & cinnamon in a separate bowl and then gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients until a thick batter forms.
        </li>
        <li>
            Fill a piping bag with the batter and set aside, then add oil to a large pot and heat to 390 degrees F. You can use a candy thermometer to measure the temperature.
        </li>
        <li>
            Once the oil is up to temperature, carefully pipe a few lines of batter into the hot oil, using scissors to break the batter off. Fry about 45-60 seconds until golden brown on both sides.
        </li>
        <li>
            Remove the fries from the oil with a spider strainer, slotted spoon or tongs. Let the excess oil drip off and then place on a paper towel to catch the remaining excess oil.
        </li>
        <li>
            Dust with powdered sugar and serve immediately

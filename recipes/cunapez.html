        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup tapioca flour (Bob’s Red Mill)</li>
            <li>2 cups  shredded monterrey jack (or preferably Queso Fresco)</li>
            <li>1 tsp baking powder</li>
            <li>1 egg</li>
            <li>1-2 tbs milk</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Preparation</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Assemble the ingredients and preheat the oven to 450F.</li>
            <li>Mix the tapioca flour and the baking powder in a mixing bowl. Add the cheese and mix well until cheese is covered in the flour.</li>
            <li>Add the egg to the mix of cheese and flour, and mix. If the dough starts sticking together, you don’t need to add milk if it keeps separating add 1 tbs of milk at that time.</li>
            <li>In this case I added one tbs of milk and made a nice ball of dough. Divide the dough in 10 pieces of the same size and shape them into balls. Put a thumbprint in the bottom of each ball (to help with even puffing in the oven).</li>
            <li>Place finger print side down on a cooking sheet. You can use a parchment paper. Bake for 15 min at 450F, you want them to be nicely golden and dry.</li>
        </ol>
